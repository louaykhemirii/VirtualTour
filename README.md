Department Discovery Game
This project is a serious game designed for kids to explore and learn about the various departments of Orange Company in Tunisia. The game's goal is to introduce the courses, materials, and detailed operations within the Orange department in a fun, interactive way.

The game was developed using Unity 2020.3.19f1 and was presented as part of my thesis during the final year of my IT studies. Please note that the project requires the same version of Unity for proper usage.

Important: Access to the chatbot login feature has been disabled to maintain confidentiality regarding Orangeâ€™s internal communications.

Requirements
Unity Version: 2020.3.19f1 (or compatible versions)
